                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>The main problem that sparked the creation of our app was the lack of such apps on the market. All the organisational, co-living apps out there did not satisfy the need of our target group: one sharable online space for roommates to organise their apartments and the chores within it.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Solution</p>
                <p>We had a white canvas. Our goal was also the starting point: the app had to be enough so that our target group wouldn’t feel the need for any other home-sharing app. An all in one space that we created with syncable and adaptable features.</p>

                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>We already had an app. Our job was creating a promotional website that was both eye-catching and informational. The main issue was avoiding iterations, so that our clients wouldn’t get bored. Our goal was for them to download the app. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Solution</p>
                <p>With that in mind we created a visual
                    centred design coherent to the app with minimum text and that would be easy to scroll through, yet intriguing enough for it to be downloaded</p>

                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>Our team’s task was taking over a website that had already been made with the goal to improve it based on further research, design choices and coding tools. The website we got handed over was not responsive for the web.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Solution</p>
                <p>The most important part was our target group study, that influenced the whole design of the website and allowed us to be focused within our choices. We re-designed every page twice, going from mobile to web.</p>

                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>As a team, our main problem was designing a website from a particular dance school’s perspective. We had to look through the eyes of a business that had to sell their product but was at the same time showing the art behind it. Research, research, research. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Solution</p>
                <p>After researching the dance itself, we had to make choices that would allow for the website to attract our target group to a point where they would feel intrigued and interested to participate. We achieved that with the creation of personas, scenarios,  affinity diagrams and usability testing. </p>
